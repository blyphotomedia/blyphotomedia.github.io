      <h2 id="about" class="border">Blog & Research</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="main"> This page will be dedicated to exploring the links between <strong>'Trauma and Creativity'</strong> whether the two have a role in how one uses their trauama to create artworks.<br>

      <br>There has been research to suggest there is a direct link, as part of the brain is accessed when one experiences trauma. However I want to explore this link further by exploring how <strong>Surrealism</strong> artworks uses <em>symbolism</em> as a form of expression, works by Salvador Dali, Andre Breton, Joan Miro and many others. <br>

      <br> The research will consist of psychology based research, along with theories by Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung along with many others.<br>

      <br> PTSD will be a foundation into exploring the links between trauma and creativity, along with neuroscientific reasearch into the processes of the brain such as the fight/flight/freeze.

      <h2 id="about" class="border">The Female Masculinity & Gender Fluidity</h2>
    </div>
      
       <p class="main"> Years after completing my dissertation back in 2013, I’ve decided to revisit my thesis on  <strong>'Queer Theory and Gender'</strong> studies. This is an ongoing subject area that has always been of vast interest to me.<br>

<br>Alongside doing a photography series on Female Masculinity and how this has changed through the centuries and is portrayed in today’s media. <br>
         
         <br> As a British Born Chinese (BBC), born and raised in the UK, I will draw on inspiration and personal experiences within the field of Gender Identity and Queer Theory, to explore the themes on Female Masculinity. <br>

         <br>As someone who doesn't identify as either 'feminine' or 'masculine' and born biologically as a female, I prefer to use the term 'Gender Fluid' because I firmly believe gender is fluid - on a sliding scale, rather than defined by preset gender roles, that society has imposed onto people.<br></p>
